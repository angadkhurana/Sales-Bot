# Client Lead Generation AI Bot

This project automates lead generation for financial firms through three main steps:

1. **Web Scraping:** Utilizes web scraping techniques to gather a list of companies based on predefined criteria, such as newly registered companies or specific financial indicators.

2. **Analysis with LLM:** Employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the gathered data and compare it against existing services provided by the company, identifying potential matches and areas for service provision.

3. **Personalized Email Generation:** Utilizes the insights from LLM analysis to craft personalized email content tailored to each target company, enhancing outreach effectiveness and increasing the chances of acquiring new clients.
